# usvg #

usvg? Î¼svg? micro-svg?

C++ SVG library: reading, writing, modifying, and rendering.  Does not support entire SVG specification but should handle most documents correctly.

### Features ###

* basic CSS support, including dynamic styling
* SVG font support
* [extension mechanism](svgnode.h#L100) enabling custom behavior - used by [ugui](https://github.com/styluslabs/ugui) to implement a SVG-based GUI
* dirty rectangle/damage tracking
* preserves document structure, including unrecognized attributes and elements

### Example ###

On Linux, `git clone --recurse-submodules` [Write](https://github.com/styluslabs/Write), then `cd usvg && make` to generate `Release/usvgtest`.  Run `usvgtest <somefile>.svg` to save an image to <somefile>_out.png and save SVG to <somefile>_out.svg.  This will also compare the rendered image to <somefile>_ref.png if present.

The makefile currently only supports Linux, but adding other platforms is straightforward - see Makefile in  [nanovgXC](https://github.com/styluslabs/nanovgXC)

## Dependencies ##
